# PyConfluenceToWikijs
Python scripts used to convert the Confluence based wiki to a format that is usable with Wiki.js.

Based loosely on [this tool by gkpln3](https://github.com/gkpln3/ConfluenceToWikiJS), though ported to python, and with enhanced capability.

Planned features:

 - Preserved page hierarchy
 - Working titles
 - Working links between pages
 - Working and organised images
 - Either automatically transferred page attachments, or at least simplified
